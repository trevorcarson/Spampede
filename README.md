# Spampede
A personalized version of the infamous snake game, designed as the final project for Harvey Mudd CSCI60
Principles learned:
- Utilzation of MVC (model view controler) design pattern
- Utilization of a linkedList to represent body of snake
- In addition to implementing a game, this project introduces a number of different techniques that are common to software development, that is, the design and implementation of large software projects.
- SpampedeData.java: Responsible for storing all the data for the board.
- SpampedeDisplay.java: Responsible for drawing the board on the screen.
- SpampedeBrain.java: Responsible for the logic of the game, e.g. deciding how to move the snake, as well as handling keystrokes and controlling the timesteps that move the snake forward.
